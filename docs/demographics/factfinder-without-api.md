Step 1: Establish Geographic Boundaries
Use the address to define the area of interest (such as a census tract, block group, or a small radius around the address).
Reference both official boundaries and local context.
Step 2: Core Demographic Profile (from Known Data)
Pull from my internal dataset (knowledge up to June 2024) including:
U.S. Census Bureau (Decennial Census, American Community Survey)
Local government and planning documents
Community surveys and reputable demographic aggregators (e.g., ESRI, Data USA, City-Data)
Step 3: Fresh, Hyperlocal Data (Web + API)
Supplement with current/recent data:
City of St. Petersburg and Pinellas County open data portals
Local school district profiles
Neighborhood associations, local news, and real estate trends
Use web search and, if needed, APIs for up-to-date data points not captured in static datasets.
Step 4: Key Demographic Variables (to be collected)
Population size and density
Age breakdown
Ethnic/racial composition
Household composition (family, single, elderly, children)
Housing (ownership vs. rental, vacancy rates, housing types)
Economic profile (income, poverty, employment, education)
Language spoken at home
Religious/faith infrastructure (churches, faith-based orgs)
Health indicators (if available)
Crime rates and community safety
Recent trends/gentrification
Step 5: Deliverables (for your team)
Facts: Bullet-pointed, sourced, precise data.
Citations: Direct links or references for verification.
Ready for the Storyteller, Visualizer, Missionary, and Synthesizer.
Step 6: Action
Define the neighborhood boundary (street radius and/or census geography).
Pull internal (AI) summary based on most recent US Census/ACS and city data.
Use the web tool to supplement with hyperlocal, up-to-date info.
Compile facts and cite sources.
Let’s begin with Step 1:

1. ESTABLISHING THE NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARY
The address is in the Historic Uptown or Methodist Town vicinity, just north of downtown St. Petersburg.
The likely census geography: Pinellas County, Census Tract 226.00 (verify boundaries to ensure coverage).
Moving to Step 2: Pulling core demographic data from existing knowledge.
Stand by for a concise, sourced demographic profile of this neighborhood.

If you have a preferred radius (e.g., 0.5 mile, 1 mile), or want to focus on a specific subset (e.g., just Historic Uptown, or include Methodist Town), let me know! Otherwise, I'll proceed with the most relevant census tract/block group.

No file chosenNo file chosen
You pick the radius on the basis of your expertise and what you believe constitutes a relevant range of factual truth, and likely knowing that the range depends on the nature of the truth. But in any event it is a local demographic study.

Proceed with Step 2.

Excellent. Based on my expertise and typical best practices for neighborhood-level demographic studies, I recommend a 0.5-mile radius around 1225 11th Street North, St. Petersburg, FL 33705. This provides hyperlocal accuracy, capturing the immediate residential context while including enough population for meaningful analysis.

This radius:

Covers the Historic Uptown and parts of Methodist Town neighborhoods.
Aligns with how city planners, sociologists, and urban missionaries often study walkable neighborhood units (roughly a 10-minute walk).
Is small enough to avoid dilution by unrelated adjacent census tracts but large enough to provide robust statistical data.
