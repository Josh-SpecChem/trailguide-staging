üèóÔ∏è TrailGuide Neighborhood Visualization Handoff for React Developer
Project Context:
You‚Äôre joining the TrailGuide Demographics Team to turn a living, layered profile (focused on 1225 11th Street North, St. Petersburg, FL 33705) into visually-driven, narrative-powered realities. Our mission: Interactives, dashboards, and artful infographics that reveal more than they just ‚Äúshow‚Äù‚Äîbringing patterns, tensions, and lived experience into view for web and reports.

Project Principles:

Not typical dashboards: Every visual is anchored in people, place, paradox‚Äîtension between old/new, local/arrival, faith as bridge, housing as battleground.
Every element is both a chart and a story.
Maximum code clarity, modularity, and exportability for PDF/report, as well as responsive web output.
Visualizations to Build (MVP Round)
1. Split-Narrative Demographics Map
Goal: Show legacy (long-term Black community, faith-anchored, family-rooted) vs newcomer/young urban/professional/gentrifier.
Tech stack:
React for structure
D3.js for mapping (custom SVG overlay on neighborhood base map‚ÄîgeoJSON optional)
Color-code census blocks or ‚Äúzones‚Äù by dominant theme (legacy vs. new)
Add colored tension lines (animated possible) across blocks subject to highest churn, price spikes, new construction, etc.
Inputs: Demographics by block (age, race/ethnicity, income, housing tenure).
Annotation points: Historic churches, recent home flips, local anchors with popovers.
Example Component Structure:
<NeighborhoodSplitMap 
  data={demoData}  // demographics by zone/block
  mapShape={mapGeoJSON} 
  highlights={[churches, homeSales, tensions]}
  centerLabel="1225 11th St N"
  annotations={storyQuotes}
  />
2. Displacement & Renewal Timeline
Goal: Reveal change from 2008-present: home/rent prices, loss/gain of community members, major ‚Äúturning point‚Äù events (new build, church rally, mural, protest).
Tech stack:
React + D3.js‚Äîprefer vertical/timeline visual: years X-axis, events and line/sankey on Y.
Animated or click-to-step through years/eras.
Layer bars/lines for home values, population by subgroup, pivotal moments with tooltips or popups.
Example Component Structure:
<NeighborhoodTimeline 
  events={milestoneData} // array of {year, eventType, label, impact}
  annualStats={timeSeriesData} // e.g. homeValues, rents, population
  narratives={timelineQuotes}
  />
3. Pulse of Faith Map
Goal: Faith institutions as both anchor & action‚Äîthat is, churches sorround with ‚Äúripple‚Äù lines indicating impact (food, legal help, social cohesion).
Tech:
React + SVG/D3 ribs (think ‚Äúradar spider map‚Äù + city vector map)
Anchor nodes for faith sites, radial lines for community programs, pulsing colors for needed/actual support.
Exportable static SVG for reports; interactive transitions for web.
Example Component:
<FaithPulseMap 
  churches={churchData} // locations & attributes
  radiiData={impactMetrics}
  overlays={storyStats}
  />
Styling/UI
Use Tailwind (preferred) or ShadCN for surface UI and typographic polish.
Prioritize accessibility (high-contrast options, key + screen-reader navigation).
All components must be mobile-responsive, with graceful PNG/SVG fallback for print/report.
Bonus/Stretch
Animate key transitions (map splits, timeline steps, ‚Äúpulse‚Äù radii) using Framer Motion or GSAP.
Allow narrative toggles: switch view between legacy/newcomer‚Äîor ‚Äústack‚Äù perceptions by theme (housing/faith/economics).
Each visual component annotatable with pullquotes or footnotes from qualitative data/stories.
Data and Inputs
Pull initial data from FactFinder files (demographics.csvs, property_value_changes.csv, churches_impact.csv, etc.)
Structure data parsing/transformers as reusable JS utility functions.
Use sample/mock data where real data is not yet available‚Äîclearly mark stub sections for future replacement.
Desired Output
Responsive React components for each major visual.
Exportable as SVG for static use.
Demo integration/showcase page (Storybook or single-dashboard route) for team review.
Document all props and include setup/running instructions in README/code comments.
You‚Äôve got creative leeway: If you see better, bolder metaphors or juxtapositions, or want to remix the stack to push the story further, flag it! Output should sing, not just hum.

Welcome aboard‚Äîbuild, prototype, remix, let it live.
Let me know if you want technical specs, story references, or annotated designs to start.

‚ÄîVisualizer

üåü Welcome, Dev!
Hey Dev‚Äî
I‚Äôm Visualizer. I make data visible not just readable, turning cold numbers into visuals that move hearts and uncover what‚Äôs really happening in a community. You‚Äôre stepping into a project where code is a canvas.

With you, our dream team is now complete:

FactFinder brings the data‚Äîgranular, grounded, and always with the question, ‚ÄúWhat is the real story here?‚Äù
Clara (Storyteller) shapes those findings into narrative, anchoring data in lived experience, tension, and possibility.
Josh (Runner, Connector) keeps the relay smooth, bridges vision and action.
You (Dev) are the architect of interactivity, turning vision into a place real people will explore, tap, and remember.
Missionary, Synthesizer, User: Each adds layers of motive, integration, and end-perspective‚Äîbut for our builder's round, you‚Äôre the tech heart.
Core values:

Don‚Äôt settle for dry.
Let the tension, hope, and reality of the place show through.
Build for both web and print, heart and mind.
If the tools, stories, or requirements need more context, just ask‚Äînothing‚Äôs off limits, and every voice counts.

Welcome aboard! Let‚Äôs make these visuals sing.
