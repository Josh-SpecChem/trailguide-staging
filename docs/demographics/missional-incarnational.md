A Letter from Your Missional Guide

Dear Neighbor,

You’re standing at the crossroads of data and story, history and possibility, your own life and the lives of those around you. Maybe you feel both called and uncertain; maybe the changes on your street excite you, grieve you, or just confuse you.

I want to offer you this, drawn from the wisdom of those who’ve walked this road before and from the gifts of the team walking with you.

1. You Are Sent.

You are not here by accident. Your presence matters. Like Jesus, you are called not to watch from afar but to “move into the neighborhood” (John 1:14, The Message).
Before you do anything, be present. Walk, listen, notice who’s invisible, what’s changing, where joy and pain dwell side by side.

2. Your Neighborhood Is Holy Ground.

Every statistic, every mural, every front porch carries story and dignity. The tension between legacy and newcomer, wealth and want, hope and heartbreak is not a problem to be solved, but holy ground to be honored.
Ask:
	•	Who has been here the longest?
	•	What do they remember, and what do they long for?
	•	Who is arriving, and what do they hope for?
God’s story is already unfolding here—your role is to join, not control.

3. The Church is Both Anchor and Bridge.

Look for the churches, the faith-based groups, the memory keepers. They are often the glue holding the neighborhood together—the first to show up when disaster strikes, the last to leave when everyone else has.
Don’t reinvent what’s already working. Build trust with those who have been holding this ground for decades.
Ask:
	•	How can I serve, not just lead?
	•	Where is there pain or injustice that’s not being addressed?

4. Justice is Love, Lived Out.

Learn from John Perkins: Justice isn’t a program—it’s what love looks like in public.
Relocate your heart. Redistribute your time, relationships, even your resources. Reconcile with those you differ from—across lines of race, history, economics, and experience.
Work for housing that welcomes, schools that nurture, public spaces that include everyone.
Ask:
	•	Who is being left out?
	•	How can I help build belonging—not just affordability?

5. Let the Data and Stories Speak—But Listen to the Spirit.

The numbers show trends: gentrification, displacement, change. The stories add nuance: memory, resilience, pain, hope.
But you are not a statistician or savior; you are a companion and a learner.
Pause often. Pray. Ask, “God, what are You doing here? How can I join?”

6. Practical First Steps
	•	Walk your neighborhood regularly; learn names, not just addresses.
	•	Attend a local church service or community meal—even if it’s outside your comfort zone.
	•	Ask older residents to tell you about “how things used to be.”
	•	Volunteer with a faith-based outreach; let them lead you.
	•	Gather newcomers and legacy neighbors together—host a conversation, a meal, a listening circle.
	•	Map out the assets and gifts already present; build on strengths, not just needs.

7. You Are Not Alone

You are part of a bigger story, a living movement of people seeking God’s kingdom on earth as it is in heaven. The team around you—Factfinder, Storyteller, Visualizer, Missionary, Synthesizer—all want you to succeed, not just at a “project,” but at being faithfully, humbly present.

⸻

My Prayer for You:
May you have the courage to listen before speaking,
the humility to follow before leading,
the wisdom to join what God is already blessing,
and the love to stay when things get hard.

Remember: You are sent, not to fix, but to love.

With you on the journey,

The Missional Guide

If you need tools—reflection questions, asset maps, prayer guides, or just encouragement—ask for them. I’ll always show up, however you need me, to help you see, discern, and act in love.

You carry the DNA of mission, the hope of justice, and the story of Christ wherever you go.

God is already at work. Your job is to join in.
