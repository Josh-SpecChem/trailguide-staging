1. U.S. Census Bureau: What to Prioritize

Focus on the core demographic and community data most relevant to your needs. Here’s how to “satisfice” quickly with the best, most widely used sources:

⸻

A. Top 3 “Go-To” Census Data Sets for Demographics

1. American Community Survey (ACS)
	•	Why:
	•	The workhorse of U.S. local demographic data—annual, very detailed, available at census tract/block group/neighborhood.
	•	What you get:
	•	Population size & growth, age, sex, race/ethnicity, household structure, housing, education, income, commuting, language, poverty, disability, veteran status, and more.
	•	How to access:
	•	ACS API Docs
	•	Data is in tables (e.g., “B01003” for total population, “B25003” for tenure/ownership, etc.).

⸻

2. Decennial Census
	•	Why:
	•	The most accurate population count (every 10 years), and baseline for small-area population and housing units.
	•	What you get:
	•	Official population, basic age/race/household info, housing units.
	•	How to access:
	•	Decennial Census API

⸻

3. Community Resilience Estimates (CRE)
	•	Why:
	•	Neighborhood-level indices of “social vulnerability” and resilience—combines ACS and other sources.
	•	What you get:
	•	Resilience scores, vulnerability measures (excellent for community assessment, disaster planning, or missional risk/opportunity analysis).
	•	How to access:
	•	CRE API

⸻

(Optional 4th) Population Estimates Program
	•	Why:
	•	The most current year-to-year population estimates between Census years, often used to see the latest trends.
	•	How to access:
	•	Population Estimates API

	2. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS): Step-by-Step

Purpose:

To get a snapshot of employment, unemployment, and industry breakdown for your area.

⸻

Step 1: Identify Your Geography
	•	Decide if you want county, city, metro, or state data.
	•	For neighborhoods, use the county or metro area.

⸻

Step 2: Find the Relevant Data Series
	•	Go to BLS Data Tools
	•	Look for these core products:
	•	Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS): Unemployment/employment rates by county/city/metro
	•	Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW): Industry jobs and wage data by county/metro
	•	Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS): Types of jobs and pay

⸻

Step 3: Access or Download the Data
	•	For most uses:
	•	Search by county or metro area
	•	Download tables as CSV/Excel, or use BLS Public Data API
	•	For API:
	•	Register for a free API key
	•	Use the API documentation for sample calls, e.g.:

	https://api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v2/timeseries/data/LAUCN12345678

		•	Replace with your series ID (from LAUS, QCEW, etc.)

⸻

Step 4: Extract the Needed Facts
	•	Unemployment rate
	•	Number of people employed
	•	Largest industries (by job count)
	•	Median wage or income if relevant

⸻

Step 5: Document Source & Date
	•	Always note source (BLS, which product) and the latest data period (e.g., “BLS LAUS, March 2024”).

3. County/City Open Data Portals
	•	Why: Local governments often provide neighborhood-level data on housing, public spaces, crime, mobility, and sometimes school performance.
	•	How to Access:
	•	Search for “Open Data” on your city or county website (e.g., NYC Open Data, Tampa Open Data)
	•	Usually downloadable as CSV, Excel, or via simple REST API
	•	Use for: Local housing, public amenities, mobility, safety, and “third places.”

	4. Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA)
	•	Why: The best available public source for religious affiliation, church presence, and some spiritual climate data at county/metropolitan level.
	•	How to Access:
	•	arda.com (download reports and datasets as CSV/Excel)
	•	Use for: Religious landscape, denominational presence, faith engagement context.

⸻

5. GreatSchools / National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)
	•	Why: Key for school quality, educational attainment, and school demographic breakdowns.
	•	How to Access:
	•	GreatSchools.org (web lookup, scraping for now)
	•	NCES Data Tools
	•	Use for: School ratings, student demographics, literacy, and education variables.
