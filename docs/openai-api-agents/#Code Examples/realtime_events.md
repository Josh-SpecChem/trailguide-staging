realtime_events.py â€” Realtime Session Event Types for OpenAI Voice/Streaming Agents
File Overview
This file defines the event types emitted during a real-time agent session, covering agent lifecycle, tool calls, audio events, errors, history updates, and guardrail triggers. These event classes are essential for building interactive, streaming, or voice-based agent experiences, enabling real-time UI updates, audio playback, error handling, and session management.

RealtimeSessionEvent	Type alias for any of the above event types.
Annotated Code Snippets
1. Agent Lifecycle Events
@dataclass
class RealtimeAgentStartEvent:
    agent: RealtimeAgent
    info: RealtimeEventInfo
    type: Literal["agent_start"] = "agent_start"

@dataclass
class RealtimeAgentEndEvent:
    agent: RealtimeAgent
    info: RealtimeEventInfo
    type: Literal["agent_end"] = "agent_end"
Explanation:
Emitted when an agent starts or ends, providing agent and context info.

2. Tool Call Events
@dataclass
class RealtimeToolStart:
    agent: RealtimeAgent
    tool: Tool
    info: RealtimeEventInfo
    type: Literal["tool_start"] = "tool_start"

@dataclass
class RealtimeToolEnd:
    agent: RealtimeAgent
    tool: Tool
    output: Any
    info: RealtimeEventInfo
    type: Literal["tool_end"] = "tool_end"
Explanation:
Emitted when a tool call starts or ends, including agent, tool, output, and context info.

3. Audio and Model Events
@dataclass
class RealtimeAudio:
    audio: RealtimeModelAudioEvent
    item_id: str
    content_index: int
    info: RealtimeEventInfo
    type: Literal["audio"] = "audio"

@dataclass
class RealtimeAudioEnd:
    info: RealtimeEventInfo
    item_id: str
    content_index: int
    type: Literal["audio_end"] = "audio_end"

@dataclass
class RealtimeAudioInterrupted:
    info: RealtimeEventInfo
    item_id: str
    content_index: int
    type: Literal["audio_interrupted"] = "audio_interrupted"

@dataclass
class RealtimeRawModelEvent:
    data: RealtimeModelEvent
    info: RealtimeEventInfo
    type: Literal["raw_model_event"] = "raw_model_event"
Explanation:
Covers all audio-related and raw model events, including playback, interruption, and raw data forwarding.

4. History and Guardrail Events
@dataclass
class RealtimeHistoryUpdated:
    history: list[RealtimeItem]
    info: RealtimeEventInfo
    type: Literal["history_updated"] = "history_updated"

@dataclass
class RealtimeHistoryAdded:
    item: RealtimeItem
    info: RealtimeEventInfo
    type: Literal["history_added"] = "history_added"

@dataclass
class RealtimeGuardrailTripped:
    guardrail_results: list[OutputGuardrailResult]
    message: str
    info: RealtimeEventInfo
    type: Literal["guardrail_tripped"] = "guardrail_tripped"
Explanation:
Emitted when session history is updated, a new item is added, or a guardrail is tripped.

5. Error Events
@dataclass
class RealtimeError:
    error: Any
    info: RealtimeEventInfo
    type: Literal["error"] = "error"
Explanation:
Emitted when an error occurs during the session.

6. Unified Event Type
RealtimeSessionEvent: TypeAlias = Union[
    RealtimeAgentStartEvent,
    RealtimeAgentEndEvent,
    RealtimeHandoffEvent,
    RealtimeToolStart,
    RealtimeToolEnd,
    RealtimeRawModelEvent,
    RealtimeAudioEnd,
    RealtimeAudio,
    RealtimeAudioInterrupted,
    RealtimeError,
    RealtimeHistoryUpdated,
    RealtimeHistoryAdded,
    RealtimeGuardrailTripped,
]
Explanation:
Unifies all event types for ergonomic handling in event loops or UI frameworks.

Class/Type Reference
RealtimeSessionEvent
Purpose: Represents any event emitted by a real-time agent session.
Variants: See above for all supported event classes.
Example Usage
1. Handling Realtime Events
def handle_event(event: RealtimeSessionEvent):
    if event.type == "agent_start":
        print(f"Agent started: {event.agent.name}")
    elif event.type == "audio":
        play_audio(event.audio)
    elif event.type == "guardrail_tripped":
        alert_user(event.message)
    # ... handle other event types ...
2. UI Integration
for event in session_event_stream:
    update_ui_with_event(event)
Tips, Gotchas, and FAQ
Extensibility:
You can extend the event system by adding new event classes and updating the RealtimeSessionEvent type alias.

Context Info:
All events include a RealtimeEventInfo object with the run context for easy access to session state.

Audio Handling:
Use RealtimeAudio, RealtimeAudioEnd, and RealtimeAudioInterrupted to manage audio playback and interruptions.

Guardrail Handling:
Use RealtimeGuardrailTripped to handle safety or validation interruptions in real-time sessions.
